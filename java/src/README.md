These are demos of new features since JDK 9/10.
Specifically:
- var
- switch expressions
- records
- textblocks
- instanceof expressions
- the enhanced NullPointerException

For each is a shell script with the name of the feature.
Alternatively, you can run `runall.sh` and they will compile and run all
(sequentially).

Each feature is minimally but (I hope) completely demonstrated. The real
value to understand a new (preview) feature is reading the code, which is
extensively documented to explain what is going on, gotchas and wows.

Enjoy!
