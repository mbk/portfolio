## portfolio
I'm building out a portfolio, covering all the subdirectories with
different tech. Right now there is a little, but expect to see this growing
over the spring 2021.

Not just to show to potential employers **how I think and work** , but
these samples should be useful for my fellow software engineers, especialy
when starting on a subject.

The vault `I'm opening up covers:
- java changes demonstrations of new features since Java 10, including
  preview
- basic sql
- some go stuff, but more is coming (see below)
- basic sql
- docker setups (in progress)
- K8S setups (coming)
- algorithms in Scala and Go (coming)

Then, slowly, as I have time left:
- spark, blockchain, kafka

The LICENSE covers all files in this repo.

Keep coming back!
